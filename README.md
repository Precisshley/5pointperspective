# 5pointperspective in p5js
Guidelines for drawing in 5 point perspective. Inspired by the functionality of an Etch-A-Sketch.

There are 4 components to the guidelines.

1. The main circle: Sets the size of the interior guidelines. Scrollwheel adjusts the size.
2. z-line: For drawing lines at the angle from the center of the canvas to the mouse. Hold the 'z' key to lock its postion and start drawing on the line.
3. x-line: For drawing lines along the x-axis ellipse (width = main circle). Hold the 'x' key to lock its postion and start drawing on the line.
4. y-line: For drawing lines along the y-axis ellipse (height = main circle). Hold the 'y' key to lock its postion and start drawing on the line.

Other controls:
'p' = toggle black or white drawing
'r' = reset
'h' = hide guidelines
'l' = toggle background colour (supposed to be night/light mode but it's terrible)
