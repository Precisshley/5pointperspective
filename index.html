    <h1>Five Point Perspective Sketching</h1>
    <p>Years ago when I was doodling in my highschool classes, I got really into drawing these funny looking spheres.</p>
    <p>If you've heard of drawing in 1-point or 2-point perspective, it's the same idea: Points on the page represent different axes. Choose a spot on the page and draw lines towards the appropriate vanishing points. The key difference is that in 5-point perspective, lines curve along the x and y axes.</p>
    <h2>How does this magical contraption perform its wizardry?</h2>
